[![Bower version](https://badge.fury.io/bo/faye-client.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/bo/faye-client)

# faye-client

#WTF?

Distribution of [faye][1] (browser side only) for [bower][2] package manager

#Installation

`bower install faye-client --save`

#Why new repo?
Faye's repo owner [didn't want][3] to take any deals with bower.

And [faye-browser][4] repo did't maintained any more. And [didn't approve][5](still opened from oct 2014) pull-requests.
Also faye-browser didn't contain faye-browser-min.js.map (but contain a link in sources).

#What if I need the older version of Faye?
In this case please use [faye-browser][4]
